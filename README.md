# Random Forest on Iris & Heart Disease Prediction

## 📖 Description

This project uses Random Forest to classify:

Flower species (Iris)

Heart disease presence

## 🧠 Model Explanation

The Random Forest Algorithm is one of the most powerful and widely used algorithms in machine learning. It's used for both classification and regression tasks, and it belongs to a category of models called ensemble learning.

🎯 Why Use a Random Forest Instead of One Tree? 

A single decision tree is simple but can be very sensitive to noise or overfitting (memorizing the training data too well). Random Forest solves this by:

Creating many trees (hundreds or even thousands).

Training each tree on different random parts of the data.

Using random features for splitting at each node.

By averaging all these trees, Random Forest makes much more robust and accurate predictions.

## ✅ Benefits

Reduces overfitting of individual trees

High accuracy and robustness

## ⚠️ Limitations

Slower training time

Less interpretability than a single tree

## 📊 Datasets

Iris Dataset: Flower classification (3 classes)

Heart Disease Dataset: Binary classification of disease presence
