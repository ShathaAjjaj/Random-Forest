# Random Forest on Iris & Heart Disease Prediction

## 📖 Description

This project uses Random Forest to classify:

Flower species (Iris)

Heart disease presence

## 🧠 Model Explanation

Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their results for better accuracy and generalization.

## ✅ Benefits

Reduces overfitting of individual trees

High accuracy and robustness

## ⚠️ Limitations

Slower training time

Less interpretability than a single tree

## 📊 Datasets

Iris Dataset: Flower classification (3 classes)

Heart Disease Dataset: Binary classification of disease presence
